# Features
<!-- list any features -->

# Getting Started
- Fork or clone the GitHub repo to your machine.
- Ensure that you have Node.js, MySQL and Gulp installed on your machine.
- If you have a password that protects your MySQL root user, enter that password in the connection.js file in the cloned repo.
- In your CLI, navigate to the cloned directory. `npm install` the dependencies and run `npm start`

  `npm install`

  `npm start`

- Once started, you are able to view the project on `http://localhost:3000/`

- 🎉Happy developing!🎉


# Linting
Before you push your branch up to the `develop` branch, ensure you lint your code.

run `npm run -s eslint .` this will show if you have any ESLint errors or warnings.
If you have any errors, please fix them. if you have warnings that could slide, push your code up or talk with a team member.

# Development 👨‍💻

The command `npm start` will automatically launch the project. navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`

The files watched by gulp are the client js and sass files.

Client side js files are located at `public/assets/js/*.js`. Editing these files and saving will kick off a gulp build and auto refresh your development workspace.

Sass files are located at `sass/partials/*.scss`. Editing these files and saving will kick off a gulp build and auto refresh your development workspace.

If you're editing any file outside of `public/assets/js` or `sass/partials`, we recommend running `npm run watch`, this runs nodemon, which watches all of our files.



### Branching process

- Master is a 🔒protected branch🔒. This means we need at least 1 approval before we merge into our master branch. (having the master branch protected helps so we know for sure what is going into master, and noone can accidentally push code to it and break our site)
- Develop will be the branch we create branches off of. Develop will be merged into master at the end of every day.
- This screenshot 👇 illustrates this process
- Feature A and Feature B are branches where we code our tasks. Once finished with making your edits, we merge that branch into develop. At the end of everyday, develop gets merged into master.
- Then develop is updated with the latest version of master, and the process happens all over again.

![screenshot](./public/assets/images/branching.jpg)

Here is a helpful reminder of the git process when creating, adding to, committing and pushing branches. Refer to this whenever needed, as working in a team environment with branches really helps keep everyones code organized and makes the project much more manageable.

```
1. Start on a clean branch

  1.1 Check which branch you're on `git branch`

  1.2 Start on develop branch, `git checkout develop`

  1.3 Do a `git pull` to get the latest copy of develop

  1.4 Create your new branch to code your story, `git checkout -b <branchname>` (Title your branch name the title of the story you're working on, replace spaces with -)

  1.5 Now you're on your own branch. Type `git branch` to see you're on your new branch

  1.6 Now write your code ✏️
```

```
2. You're done writing code, time to add your files and commit message to your branch

  2.1 Once you're code is done for the story you're working on, run `npm run -s eslint .` to see if any linting errors/warnings. fix anything that is outstanding. next we will add your changes to your branch and commit them.

  2.2 Type `git status` to see the status of the files you've worked on. (these should be red, because you havent added them yet)

  2.3 To add these files, type `git add .` to add all files

  2.4 Type `git status` again, you will now see the files are green, which indicates they have been added to your branch

  2.5 Now make your commit message that says specifically what code you changed in this story. `git commit -m "your commit message here"`
```  

```
3. You're ready to push your branch up to github

  3.1 Next, push your code up to the repository, with a `git push origin <branchname>`

  3.2 Once your branch is pushed up, navigate to our repo, and you can see branch under "Your recently pushed branches:". Click on Compare & pull request

  3.3 ❗Choose the base branch `development` as that will be the branch that you merge your branch into. (the development branch will be merged into master daily TODO: determine when we want builds to master branch to happen ❓)

  3.4 On the right hand side, add reviewers to review your pull request. Then click "Create Pull Request"

  3.5 Once your pull request is approved and merged, it will be 🙌built out into master🙌 during the next build to production. (TODO: determine when we want builds to maste branch to happen ❓)
```


### Find a bug or want to add an issue? 🕵️

- Document what the issue is, if you can find the root problem, write whatever you have down
- Go to the Issues tab, create a new issue
- Assign it to yourself if you want to work on that issue, or leave it blank and someone else can assign themselves to it if they want to take on the challenge
- Add a label to it. Most are going to be bugs or enhancement
